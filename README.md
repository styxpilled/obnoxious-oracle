# obnoxious-oracle

Small library that makes re-using my funny texts easier.

## USAGE

`foretell` - get a random prophecy.

```ts
import { foretell } from 'obnoxious-oracle';
let test = foretell();
console.log(test); // "WON'T WORK ON IE8"
```

`PROPHECIES` - list of all prophecies.

I don't know why you're here. Don't use this.

I'm including `dist/` because i feel like it.
